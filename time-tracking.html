              <h4>What is time tracking?</h4>
              <p>
                Time tracking is the process of monitoring and documenting the amount of time spent on activities, tasks, and other projects throughout the day or any other specified period of time. In a business environment, time tracking is a simple method of observing how time is spent and for calculating payments.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Time tracking is also the key to understanding how you spend your personal time, how productive and efficient you are on a day-to-day basis, which tasks take up most of your time and which, on the other hand, require more attention.

              <h4>So, how do you start using time tracking tools?</h4>
              <p>
                Opposite to what you may have thought, there's no need to count every minute and prepare tedious spreadsheets and charts to compare how much time you've spent on activities throughout the day.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                What you'll need is a good time tracking software which will do all that for you.

              <h4>1. Improve time management skills</h4>
              <p>
                Good time management is all about decision making and choosing to spend time on activities that matter. It's very easy to plan too much for your plate and in the end - not finish half of the projects you've started.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                By tracking time, you'll learn to estimate with increased precision how much time you need to accomplish the important tasks and how much time you have left for leisure. You'll be able to plan your schedule ahead and make sure every piece included in the puzzle is realistic.
              </p>

              <h4>2. Boost your focus</h4>
              <p>
                Focusing on multiple tasks at the same time is not a good idea, period. And science confirms it. A study found that only 2.5% of people are able to multitask effectively, proving that people are wired to be mono-taskers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When you're time tracking, you become aware that your time is being logged and that each minute needs to be assigned to a specific task. If you're multitasking, you won't be able to log your time accurately.
              </p>

              <p>
                So instead of trying to juggle responding to emails, cooking your dinner and seeing what your friends have been up to on Instagram, stick to a single activity at a time and focus on completing it. In the long run, you'll won't be tempted to multi-task and instead will grow your ability to focus on the task at hand.

              <h4>3. Reduce stress.</h4>
              <p>
                Planning your day with care and tracking time as you go along helps you regain control of your schedule. And knowing you're in control of your time reduces the amount of unhealthy stress.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Bear in mind that finding time for rest and personal life is as important as scheduling time for work. Tracking your time will allow you to find these nooks of time off, and you'll be able to perform better and more profitably.

              <h4>4. Find the key to your productivity</h4>
              <p>
                Some people wear their lucky pair of socks to feel like they can conquer the world. Others need just the right temperature in the room to operate properly. What makes you productive?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Time tracking in different environments and various settings can help you find the optimal conditions to maximize your productivity level.
